# Entering Site Details for Solar Energy Forecasting

Once you've added a site to our solar energy forecasting web app, the next step is to enter the site details. This information is crucial for generating accurate and relevant forecast data. Here are the fields we need you to fill out:

## Site Name

This field is for you to provide a specific name to identify your site. You can choose any name that will help you easily recognize your site in the future.

## Orientation

The orientation field is where you enter the direction that your solar panels are pointing. The direction is measured in degrees, with 0 degrees being North and 180 degrees being South. If you're unsure of the orientation, you may be able to find this information in the manuals provided by the installer. Alternatively, you can use a compass app with your back to the solar panels to determine the orientation.

## Tilt

The tilt field refers to the angle at which your solar panels are positioned. This is also sometimes called azimuth. You'll need to input the tilt in degrees. If you're unsure of the tilt, you may be able to find this information in the manuals provided by the installer.

## Module Capacity

The module capacity field is where you enter the total nameplate capacity of your site. This refers to the maximum power output of all the solar panels combined.

## Inverter Capacity

The inverter capacity field is where you enter the total capacity of all the inverters in your site. Inverters are used to convert the DC power generated by your solar panels into AC power that can be used to power your home or fed back into the grid.
