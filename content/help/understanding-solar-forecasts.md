# Dashboard Modules: Understanding Your Solar Forecasts

Our dashboard page contains several modules that provide you with information about your solar forecasts. Each module is a small rectangle on our interface that contains specific information about your solar site. Here's an overview of each module:

## Today's Expected Output

This module displays the expected total generation of your solar site for the day, in kilowatt-hours. This information can be useful for planning your energy usage for the day.

## "Sunny" Module

This module displays whether it is "sunny" at your site. It is considered "sunny" if your generation is past a fixed threshold, located at 20% of your maximum capacity. If it currently isn't sunny, this module displays the next time that it will be sunny. If it is currently sunny, this module displays when it will be sunny until.

## Daily Output at a Glance

This module displays weather icons that allow you to see how sunny the next few days will be at a glance. It also displays the total generation over each day in the next few days, in kilowatt-hours. This information can be useful for planning your energy usage over the next few days.

## Threshold Graph

This module shows a graph of today's forecast in detail. It also plots the sunnyness threshold, so you can see when it's sunny on the graph. You can interact with the graph by hovering over or tapping the forecast to see exact forecasted generation values at times throughout the day, displayed in kilowatts.

## Solar Recommendations

This module shows a recommendation for an appliance you can use with your current output. This information can be useful for optimizing your energy usage and making the most of your solar generation.

## Detailed Graph

This module allows you to see data over a timeframe of 2 days, 1 day, or 6 hours by selecting the corresponding button. The data shown includes forecast data and a clearsky line, which displays what your solar output would be under perfectly clear skies. If you have inverters connected with your site, a line representing actual outputs will be shown.

We hope this overview has helped you understand the functionality and utility of each dashboard module. If you have any additional questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.
