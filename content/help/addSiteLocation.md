# Help Page: Adding a Site for Solar Energy Forecasting
Adding a site for solar energy forecasting is a crucial step in using our web app to generate accurate and relevant forecast data. However, we understand that this can sometimes be a challenging process. Here are some common issues users may encounter when adding a site, and tips for how to overcome them:

## Using the Interactive Map
Our interactive map is the primary tool for adding a site and specifying its exact location. Here are three ways you can use the map to add your site:

- Search for an address: If you know the address of the site you want to add, you can enter it in the search bar at the top of the map. Once you've done this, the map will center on the specified address. You can then drag the map to position the location pin exactly where you want it.

- Use "Find My Location": If you're trying to add a site at your current location, you can click the "Find My Location" button. This will center the map on your current location, and you can then drag the location pin to specify the exact site location.

- Zoom in to the location: If you're not sure of the exact address but know the general area, you can zoom in to the location on the map. Once you zoom in beyond a certain threshold, a pin will pop up on the map indicating the approximate location. You can then drag the pin to specify the exact site location.

## Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues users may encounter when trying to add a site, and tips for how to overcome them:

- The location pin won't move: If you're having trouble moving the location pin, make sure you're zoomed in enough on the map. The pin won't move if you're zoomed out too far.

- The address search isn't working: If you're having trouble finding an address using the search bar, double-check that you've entered the correct address and that it's formatted correctly.

- The location pin is in the wrong place: If you've already added a site but the location pin is in the wrong place, you can click on the pin and drag it to the correct location. Make sure to save your changes once you've moved the pin.
