# Help Pages

Files in this folder (besides this README) are imported by [`/pages/help/[page].tsx`](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pv-sites-mobile/blob/main/pages/help/%5Bpage%5D.tsx) and rendered in the site's help section. These pages exist to guide a user through a certain process on the site or make effective use of a complicated feature.

## New Pages

When adding a new page, you'll need to both add the markdown in this folder, and incorporate the file in the dynamic page for all help pages: [`/pages/help/[page].tsx`](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pv-sites-mobile/blob/main/pages/help/%5Bpage%5D.tsx). After importing it and adding it to the right spots in that file, it will appear in the right spots.
